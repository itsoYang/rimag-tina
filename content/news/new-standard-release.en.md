In today's rapidly evolving field of medical imaging, iKang Healthcare Group, with its keen industry insights and deep professional expertise, is committed to the standardization and standardized management of medical imaging examination projects. As a leading medical imaging service provider in China, iKang Healthcare Group contributes actively to promoting high-quality development of the health sector with its excellent medical imaging technology and warm services.

Since its establishment, iKang Healthcare Group has always adhered to the philosophy of "patient-centered, driven by technological innovation," continuously improving the accuracy and reliability of medical imaging examinations. They deeply understand the importance of medical imaging examinations in clinical diagnosis and treatment, and also realize that the standardized and standardized management of medical imaging examination projects is of great significance for improving the quality of medical services, reducing medical costs and risks, and promoting medical resource sharing and optimal allocation.

To achieve the standardization and standardized management of medical imaging examinations, iKang Healthcare Group has taken multiple approaches. They established a professional team dedicated to developing the "Standard for Medical Imaging Examination Project Names and Codes." After unremitting efforts and multiple rounds of revisions and improvements, the standard was officially completed on December 31, 2023. The formulation and implementation of this standard not only improved iKang Healthcare Group's own service quality and management level, but also provided strong support for the development of the entire healthcare industry.

iKang Healthcare Group's "Standard for Medical Imaging Examination Project Names and Codes" covers multiple aspects, including modality classification and coding tables, equipment type classification and coding tables, examination site classification and coding tables, scanning method classification and coding tables, post-processing classification and coding tables, and patient position classification and coding tables. The formulation of these standards and codes helps to improve the accuracy and reliability of medical imaging examinations, laying a solid foundation for the interconnection and sharing of medical data.

In addition to formulating standards, iKang Healthcare Group also actively carries out research and development and application of medical imaging examination technologies, dedicated to providing patients with more accurate and reliable medical imaging examination services. They introduce advanced medical imaging equipment and technologies, continuously improving the accuracy and reliability of medical imaging examinations to meet patients' needs for high-quality medical services. At the same time, iKang Healthcare Group actively fulfills its social responsibility by providing quality medical services to grassroots areas through free clinics and donations of medical equipment. They cooperate with grassroots medical institutions to help improve the disciplinary capabilities and medical quality of grassroots areas, allowing more people to enjoy high-quality and efficient medical imaging examination services.

In the future, iKang Healthcare Group will continue to deepen ESG practices, be based on the new stage, implement new concepts, and firmly maintain its position with practical actions, demonstrating the responsibility and contemporary commitment of a medical enterprise on the new journey of high-quality enterprise development. They will actively join forces with all sectors of society to participate in and promote the construction of national, industry, group, and enterprise standards for health and wellness, playing a leading role in standardization and contributing new strength to the high-quality development of the health and wellness sector.

A few minor adjustments for improved flow and natural English:

* "standardized management" is often shortened to just "standardization" as the management aspect is implied.
* Phrases like "unremitting efforts" sound a bit formal; in some cases, simpler phrasing is used in the translation.
* Repetitive phrasing (like "accuracy and reliability") is sometimes streamlined.
* "Grassroots areas" is used for community-level organizations to convey the intended meaning.

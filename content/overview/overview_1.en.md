## II. Background and Purpose of Standard Compilation

With the advancement of technology and digital transformation, medical imaging has experienced unprecedented development. Imaging examination techniques have evolved from single X-ray diagnostics to multiple examination methods including Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and others. Medical imaging examination has become one of the essential clinical diagnostic tools. Medical imaging examination item names contain various information including equipment details, examination sites, scanning methods, positioning, post-processing, contrast agent usage, and examination purposes, serving as a crucial communication tool between clinicians, imaging technologists, and diagnostic physicians.

In recent years, the National Health Commission has issued a series of documents to accelerate the digitalization of healthcare and has established various standards and specifications to promote information interconnection, interoperability, mutual recognition, and sharing. Currently, there are no national or industry standards regarding examination item names and coding rules for medical imaging. To ensure the standardization of medical imaging examination items within the Yimai Sunshine Imaging Hospital Group (hereinafter referred to as "Yimai Sunshine"), the "Medical Imaging Examination Item Names and Coding Standard" (hereinafter referred to as the "Standard") is being developed to improve medical imaging work efficiency and promote effective resource utilization.

Since 2015, Yimai Sunshine has built a cloud service platform for medical imaging information, serving both internal and external imaging centers and radiology departments of medical institutions. The platform provides business process management, department management, and patient services. As of October 2023, the cumulative number of imaging examinations has reached 20 million, with over 250,000 different examination item names collected. After deduplication, there are 99,172 / 26,657 / 81,628 different names for CT/MR/DR respectively, making the data difficult to utilize effectively.

## III. Standard Compilation Process

### (I) Overall Situation

The project aims to develop the enterprise standard "Medical Imaging Examination Item Names and Coding Standard" (hereinafter referred to as the "Standard") to meet clinical professional examination and diagnostic requirements, comply with medical insurance payment rules for public hospitals in different regions, and address the standardization issues of imaging examination item names and codes. Meanwhile, a standard support system will be established to ensure the standard's authority, flexibility, openness, and applicability, enabling continuous optimization, improvement, and expansion during implementation, gaining recognition, adoption, and promotion from more medical institutions and healthcare practitioners.

The project was planned and demonstrated starting in 2020, officially launched in January 2021, with the first version of the standard released in December 2021. In 2022, after verification by multiple imaging centers within the group, collecting feedback and gradually improving, in August 2023, a horizontal research project was established with People's Medical Publishing House (Beijing) Innovation Culture Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "PMPH Research Institute"). After medical editorial review and multiple rounds of expert reviews, inviting medical imaging experts, standard development experts, and healthcare digitalization experts to continuously improve the standard system and content, the final revised version is planned to be released in January 2024, with official implementation within the group starting March 1st.

### (II) Main Work Process

**1. Establishment of Standard Compilation Working Group and Standardization Expert Committee**

In January 2021, the "Product Committee" of Yimai Sunshine Imaging Hospital Group, according to the group's task requirements, assembled professional personnel to form the "Standard Compilation Working Group" (hereinafter referred to as the "Working Group") specifically responsible for organizing and writing the standard compilation work, officially launching the standard compilation work.

The Working Group completed the expert team member recruitment, review, and screening processes, finally determining the experts participating in standard formulation, including experts from within the group and senior imaging industry experts from some public hospitals, thereby establishing a "Standardization Expert Committee" with professional authority.

**2. Clarification of Work Plan**

Based on the overall requirements of standard compilation work, the Working Group developed a detailed work plan, clarifying the work objectives, content, steps, time schedule, and personnel assignments for standard compilation.

**3. Resource Search and Current Status Investigation**

The Working Group gained understanding of the current status and development trends of medical imaging examination item names and coding both domestically and internationally by reviewing relevant standards and literature. Meanwhile, they investigated the usage of medical imaging examination item names and codes in the group's internal and cooperative hospitals, collecting and organizing relevant materials.

The main materials included three aspects:

**Authoritative textbooks, literature, and expert consensus in medical imaging**
From these, examination item entries and related classification methods were collected and organized, while also sorting out the definitions and operational specifications of examination items. These materials provided basic data for the selection of examination items and standardization of terminology, serving as the theoretical foundation for standard drafting.

**Standards and policy documents related to medical imaging examination item entries**
Including national and provincial medical insurance payment item directory documents and relevant regulatory documents from the National Health Commission. The definitions of imaging examination items, site classifications, and payment rules in these materials were important reference bases for standard formulation, ensuring the standard's flexible adaptability.

**Actual usage data from medical institutions**:
The organization and analysis of over 250,000 examination item names from nearly 300 medical institutions of different regions, levels, and types served by the group. Using natural language processing technology to break down imaging examination item names according to rules, and using big data technology to analyze examination names, examination sites, examination methods, usage scope, and usage frequency, the analysis results provided data support for classification rules and usage habit research in standard formulation, making the established standard have broad coverage and targeted applicability.

**4. Standard Framework Design**

The Working Group completed the first version of the standard as planned in August 2021. This version defined the basic architecture of the standard, definitions and coding formats, and released standard entries and codes, including:

* Medical imaging-related basic dictionaries and codes
* Modality and equipment type classification and coding
* Examination site classification and coding
* Scanning method classification and coding
* Examination position dictionary and coding
* Post-processing classification dictionary and coding
* Imaging examination item name structure and coding rules
* Extended item structure and coding rules

and other core content.

In September 2021, the group held its first "Standard Compilation Symposium Extended Meeting," where the Working Group reported the purpose, progress, and achievements of standard construction to group leaders and medical imaging experts from both inside and outside the group. The participating experts carefully reviewed the overall framework and specific content of the standard draft, conducted item-by-item review of the content clauses and technical indicators, and had in-depth exchanges on some key issues to reach consensus.

Based on the meeting results, the Working Group adjusted and modified the framework and content, which passed expert review at the Standardization Expert Committee's symposium on October 15, 2021, and officially released Version 1.0 of the "Medical Imaging Examination Item Names and Coding Standard" on December 15.

**5. Standard Verification and Version Update Work**

In March 2022, the group held a group-wide standardization mobilization meeting, where group leadership designated standardization work as the group's "Project No. 1," requiring all centers under the group to resolutely promote the standard, facilitate its implementation, and continuously optimize and improve the standard during its application verification process, thus initiating the standard verification work.

With the coordinated cooperation of various departments within the group, the standard was implemented and operated in 12 imaging centers. The Working Group collected opinions and feedback from the implementation and operation process, and after compilation, generated a usage situation description and issue list for each standard name. Following the revision process, the Working Group convened the Standardization Committee to carefully discuss the compiled issues and data. After discussion, the standard underwent multiple rounds of revision and optimization, updating to Version 2.5.

In December 2022, based on data analysis and expert discussion opinions, with consensus from the Standardization Expert Committee, the standard completed structural adjustments, upgrading secondary site classification to tertiary classification, extending the coding from 12 digits to 16 digits, and upgrading the standard to Version 3.0.

In February 2023, the Working Group invited multiple authoritative imaging experts from outside the group to review the standard. Over two months, they conducted item-by-item discussion and review of the standard, adjusted site classifications and project details, and completed Version 3.5 of the standard.

**6. Standard Promotion and Implementation**

In August 2023, the Working Group established a horizontal research project with PMPH Research Institute, inviting medical imaging experts, standard development experts, and healthcare digitalization experts to participate in the standard review. After multiple rounds of expert review meetings, the standard was further improved in terms of its framework, content, and format, and was upgraded to Version 4.0.

In October 2023, the Working Group organized a standard review meeting, inviting experts from the National Health Commission's Statistical Information Center, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Medical Association's Imaging Technology Branch, and other authoritative institutions to conduct a comprehensive review of the standard. Based on the review opinions, the standard was further revised and improved, and Version 4.5 was completed.

In December 2023, after the final review by the Standardization Expert Committee, Version 5.0 of the standard was officially released, and it will be implemented within the group starting March 1, 2024.
